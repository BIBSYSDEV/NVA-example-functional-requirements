Feature: Curator opens My Worklist

	"@needJiraTag" is used in several files to enable me to locate all new scenarios that is'nt in jira.
	"@updated" is used where I have changed a scenario, that exists in jira - but not updated it there yet.
	#If a scenarios is deleted, but still exists in Jira - it's noted as a comment

	Vocabulary clearification:
		- A named role is preferd over "they"
		- Resource is prefered over Registration

	Rules:
		- A User has a Host, an Institution (the IDP)
		- A Curator has a Host (works at an Institution)
		- A Resource's Host is equal to it's origin Creators' or current Owners'
		- A Rescourc has a Owner (a User)
		- The Worklist is populated with Requests
		- A Request is of a type (four possible)
		- A Request has a Sender (a User)
		- A Request has a Custodian (a Curator, that looks after it)
		- A Request has a date of creation
		- A Request has a date of status change
		- A Request have one or more Messages
		- A Message has a Writer (the User/Sender or a Curator)
		- A Message has a date of creation
		- A Request's Host is it's Senders'

	Future stuff:
		- The Custodian needs to be notified when a Request is updated (a new Message or someone adopts it)

	Background: 
		Given Curator is loged in
		And Curator opens My Worklist from main menu
		And My Worklist contains Requests of all four types
		And all Requsts are sendt by a User Affilliated at Curators Scope
		And the list of Approvals are in focus
