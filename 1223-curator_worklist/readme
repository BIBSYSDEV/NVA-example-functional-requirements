The Worklist is the Curators main tool to keep an overview of Requests from the Users. Each request is a part of a Resource (drafted or published). All Curators have access to the Worklist and share responsibillity to answer Requests from Users. 

Curators Scope
The Editor may have (down-) Scope a Curators responsibiblity to any formal part of the Institusion and thus reduce the group of Users this Curator is responsible to handle. The Curator may override this Scope to view and assist the other Curators (at the same Institution).

Search the Worklist
The Worklist offer a Seach that enable the Curator to locate Request, regardless of Type, but Results are viewed by Types. The search results may be filterd on the requests status.

The worklist has four types of requests:
    Approval:
        - The Editor decide who can publish and how it is done
        - The Curator may have to approve a publication
    Support:
        - The User may request support from a Curator from any steps in the registration flow
    DOI:
        - The User may request a DOI on any published registration (the Curator, is a User, and may also request a DOI)
        - The Curator views the content and decide if a DOI is apropriate and may initiate a dialog, decline the request or mint a DOI.
        - The User may mint a draft DOI, on a draft (unpublished) registration. If the registration is published, then a DOI request is automaticly sendt.
    Ownership:
        - Each registration is owned by a User and his active institution affiliation decide the owning institution.
        - The active institution affiliation is decided by the log in method (current Feide IDP).
        - Curator at the current owning institution decide if ownerhip should be granted or not in the two cases:
            - Any authenicated User can claim ownership to any registration.
            - Any owner can give ownership to any known User.
